online programming problems that I solved 

Most problems solved will likely be in c++. I might jump to java for a few problems, but to practice memory management I find it best if c++ is used.

Strategy: 
  1. Type out abstracted plan of how the algorithm will work for about 10-20 minutes depending on difficulty of the current problem.
  2. Use abstracted plan to implement code for about 30-60 mins, again depending on the difficulty of the problem.
  3. If you're having trouble finding a solution, then leave the problem and return to finish it the following day.
