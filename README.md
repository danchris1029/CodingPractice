# CodingPractice
Online programming problems that I have solved in the past.

Most of these problems are solved in c++ but I might use Python or Java if the problem requires modifying strings.

Strategy: 
  1. Type out an abstract plan ( withpsuedo-code or general statements) of how the algorithm will work for about 10-20 minutes, depending on how challenging the problem is.
  2. Use this plan to implement code for about 30-60 mins, again depending on the difficulty of the problem.
  3. If you're having trouble finding a solution, then just look up the solution.
  
Are you're feeling like you can't solve a problem? Forget finding a solution for this problem and read up on the terms that are presented in the question that you do not understancd. And then, once you feel motivated and prepared, you can try solving the problem.
