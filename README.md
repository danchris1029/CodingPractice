online programming problems that I solved 

Most problems solved will likely be in c++. I might jump to java for a few problems, but to practice memory management I find it best if c++ is used.

Strategy: 
  - Type out abstracted plan of how the algorithm will work.
  - Work with abstracted plan to implement code.
